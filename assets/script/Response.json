                  "Content": "<p>Everyone age 6 months and older needs to get a flu shot (vaccine) every year. The seasonal flu vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others from the&nbsp;flu.</p><p>For many people, the seasonal flu is a mild illness. But for some people, the flu can be dangerous or even deadly.</p><p>The flu can sometimes:</p><ul><li>Cause serious infections like pneumonia (&ldquo;noo-MOHN-yah&rdquo;)</li><li>Make existing health problems&nbsp;worse (for example, flu can cause asthma attacks in people with asthma)</li><li>Lead to hospitalization or death</li></ul><p>The flu spreads easily from person to person. When you get a flu vaccine, you don&rsquo;t just protect yourself. You also protect everyone around you.</p><h3>When do I need to get the seasonal flu vaccine?</h3><p>Get a flu vaccine&nbsp;soon after&nbsp;it&rsquo;s available each year &ndash; if possible, by October. After you get the vaccine, it&nbsp;takes about 2 weeks for&nbsp;your body&nbsp;to develop protection against the flu. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s a good idea to get the vaccine before the flu starts to spread&nbsp;in your community.</p><p>Flu season can be different from year to year. It can start as early as October and last as late as May. Most years, flu season is between December and February.</p><h3>What is the flu?</h3><p>The flu is caused by viruses that infect&nbsp;your nose, throat, and lungs. It&rsquo;s easily spread from person to person when someone with the flu&nbsp;coughs, sneezes, or talks. It&#39;s also possible to get the flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>Symptoms of the flu may include:</p><ul><li>Headache</li><li>Tiredness</li><li>Cough</li><li>Sore throat</li><li>Runny or stuffy nose</li><li>Muscle or body aches</li><li>Fever of 100 &deg;F or higher</li><li>Feeling feverish or having chills</li><li>Vomiting (throwing up) and diarrhea (frequent, watery poop)</li></ul><p>Remember, not everyone with the flu has a fever.&nbsp;</p><h3>How is the flu vaccine given?</h3><p>Most people get the flu vaccine as a shot. A nasal spray is available but it&#39;s not recommended because it doesn&#39;t provide the same protection as the shot.&nbsp;</p><p>The best way to protect yourself and others around you is to get a flu shot every year.&nbsp;</p><h3>Are there any side effects from the seasonal flu vaccine?</h3><p>Most people don&rsquo;t have any side effects after getting a&nbsp;flu shot. Some people may have mild side effects that begin soon after the vaccine is given and usually last 1 to 2 days.&nbsp;</p><p>Side effects may include:</p><ul><li>Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given</li><li>Low fever</li><li>Aches</li></ul><p>These side effects aren&rsquo;t the flu. You can&rsquo;t get the flu from the flu shot because it&rsquo;s made from killed flu viruses.</p><h3>Am I at high risk for serious complications from the flu?</h3><p>For some people, the flu is more likely to cause serious illness that can lead to hospitalization or even death.&nbsp;</p><p>People at high risk for getting complications from the flu include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/children.htm\" >Children under age 5</a>&nbsp;&ndash; especially children under age 2</li><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/pregnant.htm\" >Pregnant women&nbsp;</a>and women who&#39;ve had a baby in the last 2 weeks</li><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/65over.htm\" >Adults age 65 and older</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/high_risk.htm\" >People with some long-term health conditions</a> (for example, asthma, diabetes, heart disease, HIV/AIDS, or cancer)</li><li>People who live in long-term care facilities,&nbsp;like nursing homes</li><li><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/freeresources/native/protect_circle_life_factsheet.pdf\" >American Indians and Alaska Natives [PDF - 1.1 MB]</a></li></ul><p>If you are at high risk from the flu, it&rsquo;s very important to get a vaccine before the flu starts to spread in your community.&nbsp;</p><p>If you care for or spend time with someone at high risk from the flu, you can protect both of you by getting a flu vaccine.</p><h3>Is there medicine that can treat the flu?</h3><p>Yes. If you get sick with the flu,&nbsp;your doctor may prescribe medicines called antiviral drugs. Antiviral drugs can help you feel less sick and&nbsp;shorten the time you are sick.</p><p>If you are at high risk for complications from the flu, it&rsquo;s important to ask your doctor about antiviral drugs right away.</p><p>Antiviral drugs work best in the first 2 days after you get sick, but they may still help if you take them later on, especially if you are very sick.</p><p>Get the facts about <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/whatyoushould.htm\" >flu antiviral medicine</a>.</p>"

Newborn screenings are tests that check for diseases and conditions in newborn babies.</p><p>Newborn screening lets doctors find many diseases and conditions early &ndash; before your baby shows any signs. Early treatment is important to keep your baby healthy and developing normally.&nbsp;</p><p>Most tests are done before your baby leaves the hospital. They don&#39;t cause any harm or risk to your baby. <a href=\"http://www.babysfirsttest.org/newborn-screening/screening-procedures#\" >Check out these frequently asked questions about newborn screening.</a>&nbsp;</p><h3>What tests will my baby need?</h3><p>All states require newborn screening. But the number and types of tests vary from state to state. Depending on your family health history, you may want to ask for extra tests.</p><p>Most newborn screening tests use a few drops of blood taken from the heel of your baby&#39;s foot. The same sample of blood can be used to test for many different diseases, including:</p><ul><li><strong><em>Hypothyroidism</em></strong> &ndash; The thyroid is a gland in the neck that makes hormones. Hypothyroidism can cause&nbsp;problems with growth and&nbsp;development, but it can be treated if it&#39;s found early.</li><li><strong><em>PKU (phenylketonuria)</em></strong> &ndash; PKU means babies can&rsquo;t process certain foods and must be fed special formula. It can cause intellectual disability (mental skills that are below average) if it&rsquo;s not treated early.</li><li><strong><em>Sickle cell disease&nbsp;</em></strong>&ndash; This is a blood disorder that can cause problems like serious pain, infection, or stroke. If it&rsquo;s found early, sickle cell disease can be watched and treated.</li></ul><h4>Heart defects</h4><p>Heart defects (problems with the heart) can cause serious problems or death if they&#39;re not found and treated early.</p><p>Tests for heart defects use a small sensor that is placed on your baby&#39;s hand or foot. The test is painless and only takes a few minutes.</p><h4>Hearing</h4><p>A hearing test uses a small microphone or earphone to check how your baby responds to sounds. Finding out if your baby has hearing loss can help prevent problems with speech, language, and social development.</p><p>If your hospital doesn&rsquo;t screen for hearing loss, make sure to have your baby&rsquo;s hearing checked within the first&nbsp;month.</p><p>It&#39;s also important to have your baby&#39;s hearing checked regularly, since some hearing loss starts after the time when newborn screening tests are done.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/treatment.html\" >If your child has hearing loss, early intervention programs can help</a>. Early intervention programs help teach language skills and other skills to kids age 3 and younger who have hearing loss.</p>"

In fact, giving babies things like rice cereal, baby food, or formula during the first 6 months can keep them from getting the nutrients they need from breast milk.</p><p>Here are some guidelines to help you make sure your baby gets the nutrition she needs.</p><h4>Birth to age 6 months:</h4><ul><li>Feed your baby breast milk only (no formula, juice, cow&#39;s milk, solid foods, or water).</li><li>Give your baby any vitamins, minerals, or medicine that your doctor recommends.</li></ul><h4>Ages 6 months to 12 months:</h4><ul><li>Keep breastfeeding your baby.</li><li>Introduce your baby to new foods.</li></ul><h4>Age 12 months and up:</h4><ul><li>Keep adding new foods to your baby&#39;s diet.</li><li>Continue to breastfeed as long as it&nbsp;feels right for&nbsp;you and your baby.</li></ul><h3>What are the benefits of breastfeeding?</h3><p>Breastfeeding gives you and your baby time to be close, get to know each other, and bond.

The information below may help answer some of your questions.</p><h4>My baby really doesn&#39;t need other food or liquid for the first 6 months?</h4><p>Right. Your breast milk has exactly the right balance of calories and nutrients. Giving your baby formula or other foods or liquids can cause him to gain weight too fast, which can lead to health problems later.</p><p>Also, when your baby gets cereal or formula instead of breast milk, your body gets a signal that your milk isn&rsquo;t needed and starts to make less milk. The more your baby nurses, the more milk your body makes.</p><h4>Will my baby be able to sleep through the night without other foods?</h4><p>Many moms worry that their babies won&#39;t be full enough to sleep through the night with only breast milk. Actually, babies under age 6 months aren&#39;t supposed to sleep through the night&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;they need to nurse every few hours, even at night.</p><p>Giving your baby only breast milk for the first 6 months can help lower your baby&#39;s risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). <a href=\"https://healthfinder.gov/HealthTopics/Category/pregnancy/getting-ready-for-your-baby/keep-your-baby-safe-during-sleep\">Learn more about keeping your baby safe during sleep</a>.</p><h4>If I breastfeed, will I be the only one who can feed my baby?</h4><p>Many moms think they won&#39;t get a break if they can&#39;t have someone else feed the baby. But you can learn how to pump and store breast milk so your baby can eat when you aren&#39;t there.</p><p>You can also get a baby sling or other carrier to make going out with your baby easier. With practice, you may be able to feed your baby in the carrier without anyone noticing!</p><p>It&#39;s also important to know that babies who are breastfed are often healthier than babies who aren&#39;t. And that can mean less time spent at home with a sick baby.</p>"
